How does ExCollectives treat privacy differently?
When we say we care about your privacy, we mean it. Privacy policies are important documents, but many people don't read them because they are long, confusing, and written in "legalese."
We've designed our Privacy Statement with you in mind, creating links to the most common questions about ExCollectives and ExCollectives Premium Services (including Prime and Concierge) and how these services work where privacy issues may be involved. Everything in written in plain, easy to understand language.
This Privacy Statement describes what information you can share with us, how that information is stored, how we use that information, and what information other members and doctors can see when they use ExCollectives and ExCollectives Prime.
In addition to this Privacy Statement, we've created a Privacy Constitution and User Bill of Rights that describes our core beliefs about privacy and your core rights as a user of our services. These documents are located on our Privacy and Secure Sharing page, which includes suggestions for how to share securely and anonymously on ExCollectives.
