Code of Conduct for Patients
Etiquette As a patient consulting with doctors on ExCollectives, you agree to engage with the practitioner in a respectful and appropriate manner. You agree to refrain from using inappropriate language and/or behavior.
Treatment You agree that you may not make demands for treatment in a consultation. Please understand that there are three types of virtual consults on ExCollectives:
Standard virtual consults: In these consults, doctors who have accepted you as a patient (whether for “on call” care, unless you already have an ongoing care relationship with the doctor) can provide care. You may receive an examination (within the limits of virtual care), provide a medical history, obtain an assessment from a physician, and receive a treatment plan as determined to be medically appropriate by the consulting doctor.
Introductory Consult: this is the first interaction with a new doctor or a doctor who has not yet accepted you as a patient on ExCollectives. An introductory consult is not intended for the doctor to give you care. Introductory consults are for providing you with information or get to know the doctor and to determine if she or he can help you with your health concern (in person and/or through virtual consults). A doctor may need to invite you to her or his office for an in person appointment in order to accept you as a patient on ExCollectives.
Second opinion consult: this is a consult in which a doctor can provide you with information about a health issue or a second opinion on a prior diagnosis. A new diagnosis, treatment, or other care are not available in a second opinion consult.
Abuse of Care ExCollectives is intended to give you easy access to health information (and even care) on your computer or mobile device. As a ExCollectives patient (with a ExCollectives Prime membership or other access to consulting doctors on ExCollectives), you are entitled to receive medically necessary and appropriate care, and you agree not to abuse or overuse the access to doctors provided to you. Overuse includes requests for multiple opinions on single medical condition ExCollectives consults should not be used : to obtain numerous opinions on a single medical condition. In general, doctors may discourage this practice and may be hesitant to provide an assessment to those patients who attempt to seek multiple consults. In cases where there is an absolute medical necessity, it may be appropriate to do more than one consult in a day about a specific health issue, but you may also need to consider seeking in-person care or emergency services if the level of severity truly is at the point where multiple consults are warranted (especially if in-person care is recommended by a consulting doctor on ExCollectives).
Prescriptions and Lab Tests Even if you believe you need a prescription or lab test, you should not expect a prescription or lab test order from any given consult. Patients who are located outside the U.S. may receive prescription recommendations only; lab orders are not currently possible for patients located outside the U.S. If the practitioner deems it appropriate to prescribe treatment or order lab tests for the condition discussed in a virtual consult, then the prescription or lab test(s) may be ordered by the physician. Lab tests are currently ordered using Quest Diagnostics lab test services; it may not be possible to order all of Quest Diagnostics lab tests (if any) in all U.S. states at this time. . The following medication categories cannot be prescribed or recommended in virtual consults on ExCollectives: DEA category I-IV medications, lifestyle medications (such as weight loss or hair loss medication), and U.S.-state regulated medications. It may be possible to get prescriptions for some psychiatric medications in ExCollectives Concierge virtual consults, but doctors cannot prescribe psychiatric medications in ExCollectives Prime virtual consults.
Duration of Treatment There are cases when you may present with a condition that is long-standing for which you may have been taking a prescription for a long period of time. Even in this situation, it is up to the consulting doctor’s medical expertise and discretion to decide to order that prescription and for what duration. Please understand that in ExCollectives Prime virtual consults, you and the doctor most likely do not have an established doctor-patient relationship, and best practice will be for the doctor to prescribe (if at all) a short-course of medication to hold you over until you are able to consult with your established doctor.
Dress Code You agree to be appropriately dressed and to show personal or private body parts only when it is of medical relevance to do so.

ExCollectives Arbitration Agreement
Summary
ExCollectives's Terms of Use require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. Most concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting our support department at support@ExCollectives.com. In the unlikely event that our support team is unable to resolve a legitimate legal complaint you may have (or if ExCollectives has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. We request that you work with us to resolve any disputes for 30 days after notifying us of such issues before filing arbitration.
Agreement
First things first: let's try to sort it out. We want to address your concerns without a formal arbitration or case. Before filing a claim against ExCollectives, you agree to make a good faith effort to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@ExCollectives.com and responding promptly to any related communications. We'll try to resolve the dispute by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission, you or ExCollectives may bring a formal proceeding.
This Arbitration Agreement ("Arbitration Agreement") is a condition of the Terms of User of ExCollectives and the Apps. The effective date of this agreement is August 30, 2014 (the "Effective Date").
If you reside in the United States or are otherwise subject to the US Federal Arbitration Act, you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between us - except any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, our or our licensors' intellectual property rights - shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
Any arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures applicable at that time, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (to the extent applicable), as modified by our Arbitration Agreement. You may review those rules and procedures, and obtain a form for initiating arbitration proceedings at the AAA's website. The arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California or at another mutually agreed location. If the reasonable value of the relief sought is US$10,000 or less, either of us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to ExCollectives should be addressed to: General Counsel, ExCollectives, at the current company address indicated on the on the ExCollectives website (www.ExCollectives.com) ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought and the specific applicable legal basis for the requested relief ("Demand").
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different ExCollectives users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court possessing jurisdiction over the parties, except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The AAA rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees, unless our Arbitration Agreement expressly provides otherwise. If the amount of any claim in an arbitration is US$5,000 or less, ExCollectives will pay all arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, so long as (i) you make a written request for such payment of fees and submit it to the AAA with your Demand for Arbitration and (ii) your claim is not determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous or without merit under ExCollectives's Terms of Use or otherwise ("Frivolous Claims"). In such case, we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the amount of the claim exceeds US$10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, ExCollectives will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are FrivolousClaims, you agree to reimburse ExCollectives for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by ExCollectives. ExCollectives's obligations to pay these fees shall be made after a preliminary determination that the claims are not barred or limited by the ExCollectives Terms of Use. Bared or limited claims constitute Frivolous Claims.
YOU AND ExCollectives AGREE, AS PART OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. WE REFER TO THIS AS THE "PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS." UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN YOUR OR OUR CLAIM WITH ANOTHER PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER ExCollectives USERS.
Except with respect to the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions, if a court decides that any part of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to apply. If a court decides that the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions is invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.
Opt-Out Procedure
The Opt-Out deadline for optin out of this Arbitration Agreement has passed.
CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary or the applicable dispute resolution process, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or related to use of the Service or otherwise under these must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing such claim.

Consult Quality
ExCollectives Prime virtual consults are primary care consults, not specialist consults, and are not intended to address medical concerns typically addressed by medical specialists.
You agree that physicians performing virtual consults on ExCollectives Prime may prescribe allowed medications in such virtual consults when in the doctor’s sole judgement it is medically appropriate to do so. You agree that you are not guaranteed any prescription in a ExCollectives Prime virtual consult. The determination that a medical concern warrants a prescription is always made at the discretion of the consulting physician in a ExCollectives Prime virtual consult and not prior to such a consult. You agree to maintain up-to-date medication information in your Health Profile on ExCollectives so that consulting ExCollectives Prime physicians may know your medication history.
You understand and agree that ExCollectives and doctors in ExCollectives are not responsible for disconnections or connection quality issues you may experience during or outside of ExCollectives Prime virtual consults as a result of your mobile device's or computer's internet connectivity. ExCollectives may not refund you for virtual consults in which your experience is impacted by issues resulting from your device's or computer's internet connectivity.
You agree to refrain from abusive language or engaging in inappropriate behavior when with physicians during a consult and agree that a physician may terminate a consult at any time should inappropriate behavior or language be used or if in the physician’s sole judgment the consult is no longer appropriate or productive.

ExCollectives Prime offers primary-care consults from specific physicians on ExCollectives only. Consults for specialist care are not available on ExCollectives Prime. ExCollectives Prime consults are available under an “on call” model where you will be connected with the first-available ExCollectives Prime physician.

ExCollectives Prime may not cover the cost of consults that originated from searching for a specific doctor or specialty. Pricing for any Concierge consults will be shown prior to initiating such consults and by participating in such a consult you agree to pay the fees associated with such a consult.
Refunds
ExCollectives agrees to consider refunding you the cost of your virtual consult performed by video, voice, or text chat in the event that you are dissatisfied with how ExCollectives's physician spoke to you during such virtual consult. All refund requests require you to submit a documented explanation supporting your request for a refund, and all such requests are subject to review for approval (Satisfaction Guarantee does not apply to asynchronous inbox consults.) This guarantee is subject to your submission to ExCollectives of documentation supporting your request for a refund. All determinations of your eligibility for a refund are made solely by ExCollectives and are final once ExCollectives reaches its decision.
You are ineligible for a refund of subscription or one-time consult fees if it is determined at ExCollectives's discretion that you, at any time, have violated ExCollectives’s conduct guidelines within a consult (including but not limited to: inappropriate language or behavior).
You are responsible for monitoring your financial accounts and statements, and ExCollectives is not responsible for any charges actually or allegedly not authorized by any account holder. In the event that ExCollectives agrees to provide you with a refund for any reason (including but not limited to claims of unauthorized charges), the maximum refund to which you will be entitled is sixty (60) days from the time of purchase. Unsubscribing from messages from ExCollectives and/or uninstalling the ExCollectives app do not automatically cancel any subscriptions you have on ExCollectives, nor do these actions cancel your obligations to pay for any such subscriptions still active on ExCollectives.
